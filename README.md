### Installation Steps:

1. Copy the `repository_url` to **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayed8901/HRCorp_HR_ERP_project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd HRCorp_HR_ERP_project
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

   ```bash
   npm install
   code .
   ```

<br>

4. **Environment Variables Configuration**

- To run the application, you need to configure environment variables. Create a file named `.env.local` inside the root directory of your project and include the `server link` as VITE_API_URL:

* For Local server:

  ```bash
  VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
  ```

* For Vercel deployed server:

  ```bash
  VITE_API_URL=https://hr-corp-system-drf-backend.vercel.app
  ```

  <br>

  - N.B.: If you have cloned the backend project (`https://github.com/sayed8901/HRCorp_system_DRF_backend`) and perform the `Instructions to Run Locally` section properly, you can get the above mentioned `local server` link...

  - Or, if you don't want to set up the `backend local server`, you can use the `vercel server link` which I have already deployed earlier..

    - `Important:` **Uncomment** the relevant line depending on the server you are currently using (`Vercel deployed server` or `Local server`).

<br>

5. **Run the development server:**

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Finally, Access the application**

The application will be available at: `http://localhost:5173`.
