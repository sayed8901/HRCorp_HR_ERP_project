                Employees are entitled to 20 days of paid leave per year, in

                HR portal and approved by your manager. Unused leave can be
                carried over to the next year up to a maximum of 10 days.

                If you encounter any issues in the workplace, you should report

                issues.

                approval by their manager. Full-time remote work may be

              <p>
                Performance reviews are conducted biannually, in June and
                December. During these reviews, employees will meet with their
                managers to discuss performance, set goals, and identify areas
                for development. Feedback is encouraged throughout the year, not
                just during formal reviews.
